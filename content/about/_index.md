The Marmotverse On-Chain Non-Fungible Token (NFT) project will be the premiere Art project and exclusive NFT-ownership club on the Chia blockchain. Instead of storing NFT files on unsecured and centralized Web 2.0 storage, or leveraging a competing blockchain, we will be storing our assets directly on the Chia blockchain for maximum longevity and reliability.

The first Marmotverse NFT series will be Space Marmots. The Space Marmots NFT minting event will encompass 2100 provably unique Marmots. There will be a presale for each round announced to Marmotverse subscribers. The presale will be in the form of Chia Asset Tokens (CAT) that will be directly exchangeable for guaranteed Marmot NFT mints after the launch of the Chia NFT gallery(-ies).
