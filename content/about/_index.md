### How it all began
In a galaxy far away 5.3 million years ago the first marmots came into being. Not much is known about these marmota other than they were simple forging marmots; many living off various grasses and grains found on a planet called earth. The year 2022 was the first year our marmot brethren made it into space, hijacking a ride on a phallic looking rocket made not by the great human of history elon, but the other guy. Once in space the early space ferring marmots knew this was their Destiny, and so the first Marmot Moon mission was launched. Funded by a new cryptocurrency called "chia" the marmota built the most legendary rocket in marmot history the "Gopher1". Neil Armarmot first marmot on the moon dubbed the occasion

> This is one small step for man. But one giant leap for Marmot Kind


This First mission to the moon would be the catalyst that our first marmota would use in order to build the moon base "Nutria1337" and so the Marmot Moon Crew was born.

Since these fateful moments in marmot history we have since traveled many galaxies and have saved the marmot race from what would have been certain extinction. Marmot Moon Crew for life.

Long live the Marmota!


### What do we do
The Marmotverse On-Chain Non-Fungible Token (NFT) project will be the premiere Art project and exclusive NFT-ownership club on the Chia blockchain. Instead of storing NFT files on unsecured and centralized Web 2.0 storage, or leveraging a competing blockchain, we will be storing our assets directly on the Chia blockchain for maximum longevity and reliability.

The first Marmotverse NFT series will be Space Marmots. The Space Marmots NFT minting event will encompass 2100 provably unique Marmots. There will be a presale for each round announced to Marmotverse subscribers. The presale will be in the form of Chia Asset Tokens (CAT) that will be directly exchangeable for guaranteed Marmot NFT mints after the launch of the Chia NFT gallery(-ies).
